## reproduce or recreate

1. If you want to reproduce one of my stickerlicious.de stickers just pick your favorite from the eps folder and jump to step 3.
2. To create your own or modify one of my designs check the raw layout data from the ai folder. Design a new sticker and export it as an eps file.
3. Check out the next copy shop around you that offers decal plotting and get in contact.
